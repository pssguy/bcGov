Fine particulate matter is an air pollutant. Solid or liquid particles floating in the air are called particulate matter. The smallest of these particles - those that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter, or less than 1/20th the width of a human hair - are called fine particulate matter. Fine particulate matter comes from many natural and human activities, including wildfires and emissions from prescribed burning, forestry operations, residential woodstoves, and transportation.
The Canadian Ambient Air Quality Fine particulate  24-hour metric should be lower than 28 micrograms per cubic meter of air  and the annual metric below 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air
