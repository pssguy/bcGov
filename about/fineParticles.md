Fine particulate matter is an air pollutant. Solid or liquid particles floating in the air are called particulate matter. The smallest of these particles - those that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter, or less than 1/20th the width of a human hair - are called fine particulate matter. Fine particulate matter comes from many natural and human activities, including wildfires and emissions from prescribed burning, forestry operations, residential woodstoves, and transportation
